# The calibration models of script 4: one month's blue-sky albedo as a beta GAM (logit link)
# of location (x, y), elevation and the land-cover fractions ET, OL and ST.
#
# Why: script 4 wrote out the same bam() call fifteen times, once per model, and script 5
# took "model 8" as the selected model in three separate places. Each model is now defined
# once here, by its id; script 4 fits them in a loop, and the model used for prediction is
# chosen by id in config.R (analysis$calibration$model_id, question B4). A formula changes
# only by a reviewed change to this file.
#
# The formulas, smoothing bases and basis sizes (k) are exactly script 4's. The fitted
# response is the month's column itself (jan ~ ...) rather than the original get(month) ~
# ..., so a fit no longer depends on a variable `month` existing where it is used; the
# predictions are the same (tools/check_calibration_month.R).
