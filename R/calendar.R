# The calendar shared by every pipeline script.
#
# Why: the month list was typed out separately in seven scripts (four times in script 4),
# and script 8 derived each month's kernel band from its position in that list, so any
# subset or reordering of months would have read the wrong band (a four-month run would
# have given November the January kernel). Defining the calendar once, and mapping a
# month to its number by name, makes month selections safe before they become a setting
#. Written 2026-10-12.

# The twelve months, in calendar order, as the scripts and data name them.

# Check a month selection: known names only, no duplicates, not empty. Returns it unchanged
# (in the order given), so it can wrap any assignment.

# Calendar number of each month (jan = 1 ... dec = 12), by name, whatever the order or

# which would overwrite the function on the first iteration.

# such mean "annual" (review of 1 November 2026, finding 8).
