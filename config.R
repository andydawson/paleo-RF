# Project configuration: every setting the pipeline scripts read, in one place.
#
# This file is ordinary R whose value is one list of settings. load_config() in R/config.R
# runs it and checks every key against the schema in R/config_schema.R. Each run manifest
# records the settings it ran with.
#
# To add a setting, add it here and in R/config_schema.R: a key the schema does not know
# stops every script, so that a misspelt setting can never be silently ignored.
#
# Three sections:
#   analysis      settings that change the numbers the pipeline produces
#   presentation  settings that change only how figures look
#   run           where this run writes its files, and whether stale inputs are allowed
#
# A key appears here only once a script reads it. The remaining migration issues move code
# into functions without adding keys; the method options decided on
# 2026-10-14 will be added by their own issue. Where a value is a choice nobody has yet
# confirmed, the comment gives its question id in docs/cc/questions_for_andria_scientific.md (C*) or
# questions_for_andria_general.md (section number). Created 2026-10-13.
