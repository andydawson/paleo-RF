# Data provenance for the supplementary material

**What this is.** A living record of exactly how each external data set was obtained and
prepared, at the level of detail needed for someone else to repeat it: source, version,
DOI, the request or download parameters, dates, the files received and their checksums, and
any step applied before the pipeline reads them. It feeds the supplementary methods of the
paper. Chris asked for it on 2026-10-15, because this detail was missing for some of the
original data sets (see "Gaps" below).

Each entry is completed as the steps happen; nothing here is reconstructed from memory.

## 1. Land/water mask: MODIS MOD44W version 6.1 (for the land-mean albedo and elevation)

**Purpose.** To compute the albedo and elevation of each 1-degree cell over its land part
only, excluding inland and coastal water (lakes, Hudson Bay, coastal sea), so that they
describe the same surface as the land-cover fractions (decided by Chris 2026-10-14, to be
reviewed by Andria; scientific questions B5 and B9). The version and year are a proposal
for Andria to confirm.

**Product.** MOD44W MODIS/Terra Land Water Mask Derived from MODIS and SRTM L3 Global 250m
SIN Grid, Version 6.1 (`MOD44W.061`), annual, 250 m, sinusoidal grid. Layers `water_mask`
(land / water) and `water_mask_QA` (per-pixel quality).

| Start / end date | 2015-01-01 / 2015-12-31 (one annual layer) |

**The area file.** `data/mod44w/paleo_rf_area.geojson` (committed; MD5
`270cf1d829ac389658e4759a684aaa71`): one GeoJSON polygon (RFC 7946, WGS84 longitude and
latitude), the rectangle longitude -172 to -52, latitude 17 to 79. This encloses all 2,870
cells of the pipeline's 1-degree grid (cell edges -172 to -53, 17 to 79; one degree of margin
to the east), checked by point-in-polygon (`data/mod44w/paleo_rf_area_check.png`). The
edges carry a vertex every 0.5 degree, counter-clockwise, so that any viewer or service
draws them along the parallels and meridians rather than as great circles (a first version
with only the four corners was replaced before submission for this reason). Made with:

```python
import json
W, E, S, N, step = -172.0, -52.0, 17.0, 79.0, 0.5
def seq(a, b):
    n = int(round(abs(b - a) / step)); return [a + (b - a) * i / n for i in range(n + 1)]
ring = ([[x, S] for x in seq(W, E)] + [[E, y] for y in seq(S, N)[1:]] +
        [[x, N] for x in seq(E, W)[1:]] + [[W, y] for y in seq(N, S)[1:]])
json.dump({"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"type": "Feature",
           "properties": {"name": "paleo-RF study area: lon -172 to -52, lat 17 to 79"},
           "geometry": {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ring]}}]},
          open("paleo_rf_area.geojson", "w"))
```

**Delivery.** Downloaded by Chris from the request's page and copied to the workstation on
2026-10-15 (files time-stamped 11:13 BST; submitted 09:04 BST, so the request took at most
about two hours). Unzipped unrenamed into `data/mod44w/2015/` (not committed because of
size; the checksums identify them). AppEEARS records the request itself in
`paleo-rf-mod44w-2015-request.json` and the 52 source tiles (MODIS sinusoidal grid,
MOD44W.A2015001, collection 6.1 files of 2024) in `paleo-rf-mod44w-2015-granule-list.txt`.

The water mask as received: one layer, 29,761 x 74,191 pixels of 231.66 m in the MODIS
sinusoidal projection (`+proj=sinu +R=6371007.181`), value 0 land, 1 water (379,133,327 land
and 448,023,863 water pixels within the rectangle, which includes ocean); the QA layer's
codes are listed in the QA lookup file (1 high-confidence observation ... 9 model-predicted
water where the DEM slope says no water).

**Preparation before the pipeline** (to be completed with issue I16c): how the 250 m mask
is turned into each cell's land fraction and land-mean albedo and elevation, in a committed
tool with its own README; the comparison with an exact area-weighted calculation.

**Methodological precedent** (requested by Chris 2026-10-15). Found by Astra (Codex,
`gpt-6-astra`, live web search); each identity checked with RefChecker and refaudit (all
pass, none retracted) and each quotation checked by Claude Code in the full text where it
could be reached.

(Sec. 2.2, per Astra) | Confirmed by Chris in the publisher's full text, 2026-10-15 (automated access is blocked). The full methods (Sec. 2.1-2.2) also show: area-weighted aggregation from 0.5 degree to T42; the MODIS product included retrievals over shallow water within 5 km of shore or 50 m depth, with a 4% fill beyond; mixed land-ocean cells were dropped; inland water (lakes) was NOT removed, and they note a remaining lake bias. So it supports the land-only principle and the coastal correction, not the removal of lakes |

Limits, as Astra noted: none of these uses MOD44W v6.1 with blue-sky albedo at 1 degree,
and none addresses land-only *elevation*; together they support the principle (albedo
representing the land surface only, water masked, averaged to the coarse grid), which is
the defensible claim. Moody, Helbig and Oleson are in the Zotero collection `paleo-RF`. Suggested wording for the
methods: albedo was averaged over the land part of each cell, excluding water as identified
by MOD44W, following the practice of using land-only satellite albedo for coarse grids
(Oleson et al. 2003; Moody et al. 2005) and of masking MOD44W water in MODIS albedo analyses
(Helbig et al. 2016).

Unzipped into `data/gmted2010/` (not committed). Grid: 43,200 x 20,880 pixels, edges at
-180.000139 / 179.999860 E and -90.000139 / 83.999860 N: the "pixel centre" convention of its
SRTM source (report pp. 8-9, fig. 8), half a source arc-second (1/7200 degree, about 15 m) off whole
degrees; the preparation tool places it on whole degrees.

**How it is used.** `tools/prepare_land_elevation.R` averages it over each 1-degree cell's
non-ocean area, the sea being GMTED's own 0 m pixels as in New et al. (2002), lakes kept,
weighting each pixel by its area, and writes `data/elev_land_mean_cells.csv`
(committed). Precedents: New et al. (2002), Climate Research 21:1-25, doi:10.3354/cr021001,
p. 7; ISLSCP II HYDRO1k (Verdin 2011, doi:10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1007, sec. 9.2.1). Run of
2026-10-15: 2,870 cells, 3 to 3,018 m, 0.3 minutes. (A first version took the sea from MOD44W's
ocean class; both reviewers found it starts about 1 km offshore and labels Nettilling Lake as
ocean, so Chris chose the DEM's own sea.) Limitation: in four cells of eastern Baffin Island
GMTED does not resolve the fjords.

**Suggested wording.** "Elevation for each 1-degree cell is the mean of the GMTED2010
30-arc-second mean-elevation product (Danielson and Gesch, 2011) over the cell's land and
lake area, the sea being the product's own sea-level pixels, following New et al. (2002)."

## Gaps in the provenance of the original data sets

From the README's data table and general question 4, still to be obtained from Andria:
the construction of `blue_sky_monthly_2000-2009.tif` (MODIS MCD43A3 v061 plus ERA5: code
and who ran it); the origin and version of `grid.RDS`, the political boundary polygons and
`taxon2LCT_translation_v2.0.csv`; the source of the glacier polygons
(`glacier_shapefiles_21-1k.RDS`) and of the glacier albedo values; who interpolated the
Dalton et al. (2020) ice fractions and how; the R and package versions of the original
results. The kernels and IPCC data are documented in the README (source, DOI, download date).
