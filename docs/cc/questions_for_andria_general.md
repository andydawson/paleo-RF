# Open questions for Andria: general

Maintained by Chris with Claude Code; kept current as work proceeds (see
AGENTS.md). Technical and scientific questions are in
`questions_for_andria_scientific.md`. Updated 2026-09-18. Only questions
that are still open are listed; answered or superseded items are removed
(e.g. the REVEALS and interpolation code, now agreed to be out of scope;
the point / non-interp path, now dropped; the interpolated posteriors and
ice shapefiles, received 2026-09-17).

## 1. Time slices in the interpolated land-cover file

The interpolated land-cover file you sent has 25 time slices: 50, 200,
500, then every 500 years to 11,500, and beyond. The scripts in the repo
use a shorter list, 50, 200, 500 to 11,500 in 500-year steps, and the
draft methods describe a different set again, with irregular bins in the
last two millennia (0-100, 100-350, 350-700, 700-1,500) and 1,000-year
bins before that. Which set of slices should the paper use, and are the
slice boundaries in the file the ones the REVEALS reconstruction was
actually run on? Also, does each slice value in the file represent a bin
centre or a bin edge?

## 2. Content of `veg_posts_interp_ice.RDS`

- The `ice` column is NA for the rows we looked at. What values does it
  take, and does it mean the cell was masked for that slice, or partly
  ice-covered?
- Are the 200 `iter` values posterior draws from the interpolation model
  (so that each draw is a coherent map), or independent per cell?
- `cell_area`: units (km²?) and on which projection?
- Cells: 2,870. Is that the full land mask of the study region, and is
  the 1-degree grid the same as `data/grid.RDS`?

## 3. Data files still needed for scripts 7a and 8

- `data/Dalton_QSR_2020_Ice/dalton_interpolated_LC6k.tif`: the Dalton et
  al. 2020 ice-fraction raster interpolated to the time slices (script 7a).
  Checked 2026-09-19: the Dalton margins are paywalled with no open
  repository found, and this file is a derived interpolation specific to
  this project, so it cannot be downloaded. See C0b.
- `data/albedo_glacier_monthly.csv`: the monthly glacier albedo assigned
  to ice-covered cells (scripts 7 and 7a). Checked 2026-09-19: this is
  not a published dataset but a set of chosen values (columns `month`,
  `ice_albedo`, `ice_albedo_fixed`, `ice_albedo_sc`), so we cannot
  obtain it independently. See C0a in the scientific questions.
- `data/radiative-kernels/CACKv1.0/CACKv1.0.nc` (script 8): the other two
  kernels were downloaded on 2026-09-19 from Zenodo (HadGEM3
  doi:10.5281/zenodo.3594673, CAM5 doi:10.5065/D6F47MT6) and verified to
  contain the variables the script reads. CACK is published through the
  Environmental Data Initiative (`edi.396.1`), whose portal is behind a
  human-verification check, so it needs a manual download. Do you still
  have the file? Also: did you preprocess any of the three, or use them
  as downloaded? And which CACK band is band 3?
- *Added 2026-10-15, from Astra's snow and water review:* the code (or the Earth Engine
  script) that built `data/blue_sky_monthly_2000-2009.tif` from MCD43A3. Its band labels
  say `median` where the README says mean, and how it treated snow, quality flags and
  water decides whether the land-only albedo can be done exactly. See B2c and B5.
- *Added 2026-10-15:* monthly snow fields (cover or water equivalent) from the Holocene
  HadCM3 simulations of Hopcroft et al. (2026), if they can be shared. See B2d.

### 3a. For Chris: downloading the MODIS water mask (MOD44W) for the land-mean albedo (2026-10-15)

Needed before the land-support part of issue I16 (i16c). It needs a NASA Earthdata login,
so Chris downloads it. The version and year are still a proposal for Andria to confirm
(scientific question B5): version 6.1, the 2015 annual layer. Another year is one more
request of the same kind.

1. Go to AppEEARS, https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/, and sign in with Earthdata.
2. Extract > Area > Start a new request.
3. Name: `paleo-rf-mod44w-2015`.
4. Area: draw or upload a rectangle covering the grid: west -172, east -52, south 17, north
   79 (degrees; the 1-degree grid's cells span lon -172 to -53, lat 17 to 79).
5. Dates: 2015-01-01 to 2015-12-31 (one annual layer).
6. Layers: product `MOD44W.061` (Terra Land Water Mask, 250 m, yearly); layers
   `water_mask` and `water_mask_QA`.
7. Output: file format GeoTIFF; projection **Native Projection** (sinusoidal), so that the
   250 m pixels are not resampled.
8. Submit. When the e-mail arrives, download every file of the request (the .tif files,
   and the README and `*-request.json` it includes).
9. Put them, unrenamed, in `data/mod44w/2015/` of the repository checkout (not committed:
   the pipeline records their checksums), and tell Claude.

Not needed from Chris: the elevation model (fetched without a login).

## 4. Provenance to record in the data documentation

- The blue-sky albedo GeoTIFF (`blue_sky_monthly_2000-2009.tif`): the
  MODIS MCD43A3 v061 plus ERA5 construction described in the methods. Is
  the code for that step available anywhere, and who ran it?
- `grid.RDS`, the political-boundary polygons and `taxon2LCT_translation_v2.0.csv`:
  origin and version.
- The R version and package versions used for the results in the talk
  (there is no renv lock or sessionInfo in the repo).

## 5. Method choices to confirm for the write-up

- The manuscript says 1,000 posterior samples per cell and month; the
  scripts draw 100. Which is intended? **Chris, 2026-10-14: 100 for both scripts 5
  and 6 during development; 1,000 for both possible for the final results,
  not decided** (scientific A3).
- Snow is never modelled: the 2000-2009 snow climatology enters through
  the location and elevation terms and is held fixed for every slice. You
  said the snow / water-budget branch was dropped deliberately. Should the
  paper state the fixed-modern-snow assumption explicitly in methods and
  limitations?

## 6. Repository logistics

- The 334 MB posteriors file is now in the repo via Git LFS. LFS storage
  and download quota count against the repo owner's GitHub account (free
  tier: 1 GB each). Is that acceptable, or should large files live
  elsewhere (e.g. Zenodo / OSF with a download script)?
- **Scripts outside the pipeline: answered (Chris, 3 November 2026).** Archived, not deleted: the 18
  scripts (`scripts/archive/`, `GCM_snow_prob.R`, `thornthwaite.R`, `beta_veg_lct_modern.R` and
  `6_prediction_model_spatial_eval.R`) are now unchanged in a root-level `archive/` folder, whose README
  says what each did and what replaced it (issue #26; Astra's review,
  `docs/cc/2026-11-03_old_scripts_review_codex_gpt6astra.md`). Still for you: did any figure or table
  you have shown or kept depend on them, and do their inputs (the ABoVE and GlobAlbedo extracts, the
  ClimateNA outputs) survive anywhere? The source of the custom ABoVE monthly albedo and snow rasters
  (`data/ABOVE/snow/snow-month-%02d.tif`) is not recorded.

## 7. Small code questions raised by the configuration migration (2026-10-08)

Found while designing the move to a single config file. None is urgent;
answers let us delete code rather than carry it.

- **Three map windows.** Script 7 draws its maps on -166..-50 E, 12..82 N
  (scripts 7a and 8 also set that window but never drew with it; the unused
  copies were removed in migration issue I03, 2026-10-13); scripts 2 and 3
  use -172..-50, 15..80; script 1's diagnostics use -172..-50, 17..79.
  Inherited, not chosen; on the migration branch they are now the three
  `presentation$map_windows` in config.R. One window for the paper, or keep
  the two?
- **Model 8 is fitted twice with the same formula** in script 4: once in the
  model comparison and once as the spatial experiment "elevation and cover
  with location" (`spatial_elev_cover`). Can the second go, with script 5
  reading model 8 from the comparison? (Updated 2026-10-15: the third fit,
  which overwrote the comparison's copy, is now the separate REML fit used
  for prediction, since the comparison is fitted by ML; issue I16.)
  (Checked 2026-10-16 on the original files: the two fits are identical, same formula and
  rows, fitted values differ by 0. Chris: leave it for now and record it.)
- **The model-structure sensitivity check** (`6_prediction_model_spatial_eval.R`): archived with the
  scripts above (Chris, 3 November 2026). Its question, whether the location term changes the vegetation
  effect, is now addressed by the northeast diagnostic (`tools/plotting/plot_northeast_cover_and_location.R`),
  which could be extended to other months and regions if you want it for the paper.

## 8. Figure and code slips found in the readability review (2026-10-13)

Found by the design review for the readability cleanup (migration issue
I15, Codex `gpt-6-astra`), checked against the code by Claude Code. Each
fix changes a figure or a printed number, so none is made silently: the
first four are marked with a comment beside the figure code on the
migration branch. Line numbers are for `chris-dev`. Shall we fix them?

- **Script 7's per-age tile pages plot every age on every page**
  (`7_plot_preds.R:303`). Inside the loop `for (year in ages_sub)`,
  `subset(alb_grid_sub, year==year)` compares the `year` column with
  itself, so every row is kept and each page of
  `alb_interp_preds_month_binned_tile_pages_bluesky.pdf` overplots all
  ages; only the ice outline changes from page to page.
- **Script 2's native-vs-coarse scatter has its axis labels swapped**
  (`2_calibration_lct_bluesky.R:145-147`). After the merge, `value.x` is the
  native albedo and `value.y` the coarse one, but the x axis is labelled
  "albedo resampled coarse" and the y axis "albedo native".
- **Script 7's CV map uses the SD legend labels** (`7_plot_preds.R:355`):
  the CV bins are cut with `breaks_cv` but labelled with `labels_sd`, so
  the legend shows SD ranges.
- **Script 7's difference maps miss the ice outline for the two youngest
  ages** (`7_plot_preds.R:430-432`). The outlines are looked up by
  `ice_fort$ages == ice_years[...]`, i.e. by the requested age against the
  nearest ice year (1, 2, ... 21 ka); 50 and 500 BP have no exact match,
  so the 0.05-0.5 ka and 0.5-2 ka panels draw no young (and for 0.05-0.5 ka
  no old) outline. Probably minor at those ages, but not intended.
- **Calibration coverage counts missing rows in the denominator**
  (`5_calibration_eval.R:183`, `:188`): `sum(in_credible, na.rm=TRUE)/n()`
  lowers `frac_in` in `calibration_model_stats.csv` if any cell has a
  missing observation or interval. Should missing rows be excluded?
- **Script 7a's complete-age filter is built but not used**
  (`7a_alb_diff_full.R:167-172`, loop from `:217`): the table without
  incomplete cells is computed and then ignored, and the loop skips only
  cells with a single age. Script 1's diagnostic warning that "script 7a
  will drop them" (`1_veg_lct_prep.R:140`) is therefore not accurate. Today
  this changes nothing (every incomplete cell lies outside 27-74 N and is
  trimmed in script 8, see the scientific file), but should 7a drop them,
  or should the filter and the warning go?

*Added 2026-10-15, from the methods-from-code pilot on the calibration stage:*
- Script 5 labels each month's panel with the correlation of the fitted mean, but the
  statistics table reports the correlation of the median of the draws; they differ in April
  (0.99 against 0.98). Which should the paper quote?
- Script 5's November "model comparison" computes an AIC table and an analysis of deviance but
  neither prints nor saves them (lines 348-354); script 4's analysis-of-deviance list (line 70)
  is likewise computed and discarded. Keep and save them, or remove them?
