# Open questions for Andria: scientific and technical (from 20 October 2026)

Maintained by Chris with Claude Code; kept current as work proceeds (see
AGENTS.md). This file holds the scientific questions raised **from
20 October 2026 onwards**. The earlier questions are in
`questions_for_andria_scientific.md`, which is frozen as of that date: its
content went into the Word document Chris shared with Andria on Google
Drive, and her answers are being collected there. Keeping the new
questions in a separate file lets Chris copy them across by hand.

Each entry says what we found, why it matters, what we propose to check,
and what we need from you.

## 1. The model predicts a darker surface where hemlock collapsed (northeast, 6 to 4 ka)

*Raised on the 19 October call (Chris: check against figure 4a of the
Climate of the Past paper, Dawson et al. 2025); analysis 20 October.*

**What we found.** In the northeastern US and southeastern Canada (box
80-66°W, 40-48°N, the region of figure 4a), the land-cover reconstruction
shows evergreen cover falling from 0.40 at 6 ka to 0.23 at 4 ka, and
summergreen rising from 0.54 to 0.71: the hemlock decline. Replacing
conifers with deciduous trees would normally make the surface brighter,
especially over spring snow, which should give cooling. Instead the
calibration model predicts a darker surface in almost every month, by up
to 0.09 in April and May, so our 4-6 ka bar shows warming in that region
(18 October headline run, partial ice, HadGEM3 kernel). Eastern Canada
shows the same pattern where evergreen cover expanded.

**Why it matters.** The predicted values look implausible. At 4 ka the
median May albedo in the box is 0.068 and some cells reach 0.040, while
the satellite albedo today in the same cells is 0.116. If the model is
wrong here, the sign of a regional signal your paper highlights is wrong
in our forcing, and the same may happen wherever the past cover mix lies
outside the range of today's mixes.

**Possible causes (not yet confirmed).**
- The cover term is confounded with location: in the box, evergreen share rises
  northwards with latitude, so the fitted cover surface can take a steep slope that the
  location term offsets today but not when the cover changes in the past.
- The model is extrapolating: past cover mixes in this region lie outside
  the mixes it was fitted on today, and the fitted smooth bends the wrong
  way there.
- Water in the calibration albedo: lakes and coastline mixed into your
  0.25° albedo raster may have taught the model that some cover mixes are
  very dark.

**Further evidence (20 October, same run).**
- The forcing in the box is vegetation only after 9.5 ka; the ice part is zero there in
  every period from 8 ka onwards.
- The forcing follows the evergreen curve with no lag. Evergreen falls from 6 to 4.5 ka
  (0.40 to 0.22), giving warming (+5.2 W/m2 over the box for 4-6 ka). It then recovers
  from 4 to 0.5 ka (0.23 to 0.37), giving cooling (-2.9 for 2-4 ka, -1.7 for 0.5-2 ka).
  The cooling after 4 ka is the same effect in reverse.
- At a fixed place in the box, the May model gives albedo 0.06 for 10% evergreen and
  0.49 for 60% evergreen (open land fixed at 6%). Both ends are implausible for forest.
- The data the model was fitted on point the other way. Across the 83 box cells today,
  May albedo falls as evergreen share rises (correlation -0.63). Evergreen share is almost
  a function of latitude there (correlation 0.92), so the location term and the cover term
  can trade off against each other (related to question B3 in the earlier file).
- The 4.5 ka cover mixes lie outside the mixes the model was fitted on: the median distance
  to the nearest modern mix is 0.12 in cover fraction, against 0.04 at 6 ka.
- Checked for May with the selected model only; other months are not yet checked.

**Three checks, 20 October (fits the hindcast uses).**
- *No modern counterpart for most of the Holocene.* On the cover triangle, nearly every box cell
  lies outside the range of all of today's North American cover mixes from 1 ka to 8 ka (99% at
  1 ka, 100% at 4.5 ka, 98% at 6 ka; 15% at 0.2 ka). The past forest there had little open land
  (about 6%); every modern cell with that much summergreen has more open land. Across the whole
  study area, 10-15% of past cells lie outside today's range at each time slice.
- *It is the conifer-to-deciduous swap.* Replacing evergreen by summergreen alone, with open land
  held fixed, reproduces almost the whole modelled 6 to 4.5 ka change in every month (May -0.094
  against -0.095).
- *The sign depends on the location term.* Refitting May on the same data without the location
  term turns the box's 6 to 4.5 ka change from -0.095 (darker) to +0.042 (brighter), but the fit to
  today's albedo falls from 97% to 67% of deviance explained. The data cannot pin down the
  evergreen effect here.

**Diagnostic figures (made 20 October; scripts in `tools/plotting/` on the migration branch).**
- `plot_training_support.R`: the cover triangle with today's mixes, their outer range and the past
  mixes outside it; the share outside at each time slice; and a map of how often each cell is
  outside. The log gives the share outside by more than 0.02, 0.05 and 0.10, since the outer range
  is a strict test.
- `plot_forcing_vs_training_support.R`: the vegetation forcing of each period with the cells
  outside the range outlined, showing which regional signals rest on extrapolation.
- `plot_pollen_site_coverage.R`: the cells with a pollen-based cover estimate before
  interpolation. It bears also on question B2 of the earlier file (calibration on the interpolated
  field): the northeast is well sampled, the southern Plains very sparsely.

**What we propose to check.**
- The model's fitted albedo for pure evergreen and pure summergreen cover,
  month by month, against published values for conifer and deciduous
  forest.
- Whether the past cover mixes in the box fall outside the range of
  today's mixes used in the fitting.
- Whether the effect disappears with the land-only satellite albedo now
  being rebuilt.
- Spatially blocked cross-validation (already proposed on 16 October),
  which measures how well the model predicts places and mixes it has not
  seen.

**What we need from you.** Have you seen dark predicted albedo for
mixed conifer-deciduous cover before? Do you know whether your albedo
raster excluded water? And do you agree that the hemlock decline should
give a brighter surface, and so cooling, in this region?

## 2. Questions raised by the independent review of the hemlock result

*From Astra's interpretation of the northeast result, 20 October
(`2026-10-20_northeast_cover_effect_interpretation_codex_gpt6astra.md`). Its leading explanation:
in today's data, evergreen share follows latitude so closely that the model cannot tell the effect
of evergreen cover apart from the effect of being further north (colder, snowier); and the 4.5 ka
cover mixes have no close modern counterparts. Checks are under way.*

1. **What should the vegetation forcing represent?** The effect of past vegetation under today's
   climate and snow, or the total albedo change including past changes in snow? The model has no
   input for past snow.
2. **Which modern observations best show hemlock being replaced by deciduous forest in the
   northeast?** We would use them to test the direction of the model's effect.
3. **What do the pollen-based cover fractions measure:** share of land area, of vegetated area, or
   canopy cover? And how should shrubs map onto satellite land-cover classes?
4. **Which years does the "modern" (50 BP) vegetation slice represent,** and is it a fair match for
   satellite albedo from 2000-2009?
5. **Was taking the albedo at the cell centre deliberate?** Could the rebuilt land-only cell averages
   become the calibration albedo instead?
6. **Past cover mixes with no modern counterpart:** should their forcing be left out, given as a
   bounded range, or shown separately as unsupported?
7. **Would a snow-aware estimate built from albedo per cover class** (evergreen, deciduous, open;
   snowy and snow-free) be enough as a comparison for the paper, or should it replace the model if
   the model's cover effect stays unstable?

## 3. The rebuilt satellite albedo: choices made, and questions still open

*From the two independent reviews of the rebuilt MODIS albedo (20 October). Chris decided the
following on 20 October; they replace the wording in the earlier file (question on snow in the
satellite albedo), which said the land rule follows NASA's processing and that "no minimum" follows
published climatologies; both reviews found those statements wrong.*

**Decided (for your review).**
- A pixel counts as land if the product labels it land on more than half of the days it has a
  reading (2000-2009). Days without a retrieval are blank and are ignored. Keeping only land pixels is
  our choice: NASA also processes coastlines and shallow water.
- Days when the noon sun is more than 75 degrees from overhead are left out (as Jia et al. 2022 do);
  versions with 70 degrees (NASA's guidance that values beyond 70 are suspect) and with no cut-off are
  kept for comparison. Your raster shows no such cut-off: its winter values reach the north as far as a
  noon sun 80-85 degrees from overhead.
- Snow: the product's own daily snow flag. The build keeps snowy, snow-free and unknown-snow day
  totals; together with the unknown-snow part they mix back exactly to the all-days value.
- Averaging: within each year, the mean over all usable land pixel-days of the cell; then the years
  weighted equally. A mean, not a median, because forcing is linear in albedo (our judgement).

**Shoreline pixels: land only (Chris, 22 October, from the four test months; your view welcome).**
The product labels pixels touching a lake shore or coastline as a separate class. They are not
counted as land: the cell albedo is meant to describe the land surface the vegetation
reconstruction stands for, and these pixels mix in water. They matter in lake country and on coasts:
in the test months (March 2000, March 2005, July 2005, December 2005) the median cell has 15% of its
land-or-shoreline pixels on shorelines, and 44% of cell-months have more than 20%. Counting them would
make such cells darker by about 0.006 on average (5-95% range -0.04 to +0.03 where shoreline is over
half), mostly in summer (open water; July -0.005 overall) and hardly in December (-0.001). It would
add an albedo to only 52 of 7,078 cell-months. The build keeps the shoreline days per pixel, so this
can be changed later without rebuilding.

**Current defaults (Chris, 20 October). They can be changed later without rebuilding; tell us only if
you disagree.**
- *Today's snow share* = the share of usable satellite retrievals flagged snowy (it depends on cloud,
  quality and sun-angle screening), rather than a snow fraction from a separate snow-cover product.
- *No minimum coverage:* every cell-month with any usable retrieval is used, and the counts (years,
  days, share of land observed) are kept beside each value. In July 2005, 30% of cells had
  full-quality retrievals for under 90% of their land (mostly Alaska and south of 30 N); there the
  full-quality and any-quality values differ by 0.014-0.020 on average.
  In late winter the full-quality requirement removes much more in the north: north of 60 N, the land
  pixels with at least one full-quality day in March 2005 were about half those with any usable day
  (5.9 against 12.1 million; July 2005: 10.3 against 12.7 million). Both versions are kept with their
  coverage, so the choice can be revisited once the whole decade is built (Chris, 22 October).
- *Days with unknown snow status* stay in the all-days value; their share and mean are reported, so
  the snowy, snow-free and unknown parts mix back exactly.

**Also decided (Chris, 20 October, for your review).**
- *Noon albedo.* The calibration albedo is the blue-sky albedo at local solar noon, which is what the
  MODIS albedo product provides (its direct-light albedo is defined for the noon sun; a
  sunlight-weighted daily albedo would need a different product). This is common practice: Bright et
  al. 2015 (Biogeosciences) use the MODIS direct-light albedo at local solar noon, Duveiller et al.
  2018 use the same noon-based product, and the Copernicus albedo product also defines its
  direct-light albedo at local noon. Your raster was very probably noon-based too, if it was made from
  the MODIS albedo product. Caveat for the methods: the radiative kernels respond to a monthly albedo
  that is in effect weighted by the day's sunlight; at low sun (snow, high latitudes) noon albedo is
  somewhat lower. Because the forcing uses differences between time slices, much of that offset
  should cancel (our reasoning, not yet checked).

## 4. Model 7 does not converge in January and May (follow-up to B4 in the earlier file)

In the headline 19 October run, model 7 stopped at the 500-step limit in January and May
(500 iterations in the saved fits), although it converged in those months in the 18 October run
(the table under B4), so neither month's 7-against-8
comparison there rests on a converged fit. A check refitting model 7 for those two months with
a 2000-step limit (started 22 October) was stopped unfinished on 26 October (Chris's decision):
it was not needed for any regression test, and with the machine shared by other jobs it had run
almost four days, against about two and a half hours for 500 steps on 19 October. The check
moves to the refit on the rebuilt MODIS albedo, where every model is fitted again; there, run
R's maths library (OpenBLAS) at one thread, because 48 threads per R process waiting on each
other was what made it slow.
