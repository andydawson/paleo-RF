# paleo-RF

Estimating Holocene radiative forcing from land-cover change in North
America, using land cover inferred from fossil pollen, a modern
satellite-albedo calibration, and radiative kernels.

**Status: research code under active development.** The pipeline runs end
to end as of 2026-09-21 and its outputs are frozen as regression anchors.
This README was last brought up to date on 2026-09-23. The authoritative
descriptions of the scripts and data are in `docs/cc/`; see the index at
the end.

## What the pipeline does

1. Land-cover fractions per 1-degree cell and time slice, three classes:
   evergreen trees (ET), summergreen trees (ST), open land (OL). These
   come from the REVEALS pollen-vegetation model followed by a Bayesian
   spatial interpolation with an ice mask, both done outside this
   repository (Dawson et al., Climate of the Past); the product is a
   fixed input here.
2. A modern blue-sky albedo climatology (MODIS MCD43A3 + ERA5, 2000-2009,
   monthly) is sampled at the modern cells.
3. Twelve monthly calibration models (beta-regression GAMs, `mgcv::bam`)
   relate albedo to location, elevation and the three cover fractions.
4. The models hindcast albedo for every Holocene slice from the paleo
   cover fractions, with posterior draws.
5. Albedo differences between consecutive slices are split into
   vegetation and ice-sheet contributions and multiplied by a radiative
   kernel to give forcing in W/m² per cell and month.
6. The per-cell forcing is aggregated to continental values by period and
   set beside the modern IPCC forcing agents.

## Repository layout

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| `scripts/` | the R pipeline, numbered in run order |
| `R/` | helpers sourced by the scripts (`run_manifest.R`) |
| `tools/` | shell and Python helpers that are not part of the pipeline |
| `data/` | inputs, plus some intermediates the scripts still write here |
| `output/` | fitted models, predictions, forcing (git-ignored except small summary tables) |
| `figures/` | figures (git-ignored; regenerable) |
| `runs/` | one provenance manifest per script run |
| `tests/anchors/` | frozen outputs a refactor must reproduce |
| `docs/cc/` | reviews, plans, question lists and other generated documents |
| `writing/` | the draft manuscript, the EGU talk and the reference papers |

## The point flavour

The pipeline originally ran on the ~505 cells that contain pollen sites
(the point, or non-interp, flavour). Shortly before the EGU talk it was
switched to the spatially complete, interpolated maps (the interp
flavour, files carrying `_interp`), which is the analysis in the talk
and the draft paper. By agreement with Andria (2026-09-17) the point
flavour is not developed further; it is kept only so it can be revived.
Its scripts, data and the two runs made of it are documented in
`docs/cc/README_nointerp.md`, and its outputs are anchored. Everything
else in this README describes the interp flavour.

The point blocks are still present inside the scripts, guarded so they
do not run unless their inputs are on disk, and in script 7 additionally
behind `RUN_NOINTERP=1`. The code also ties the flavour to a month
choice (the point path fits one month, the interp path all twelve), which
has nothing to do with interpolation; separating the two switches is on
the roadmap for the config stage
(`docs/cc/2026-09-18_staged_plan_development_to_package.md`).

## Scripts (`scripts/`)

Files are named as the scripts write them, with `<month>` standing for
`jan` ... `dec`. Line numbers (`script:line`) refer to the scripts on
`chris-dev` and give the statement that loads the file. Everything the
pipeline writes goes under `output/` except where a script still writes
into `data/`.

| Script | Does |
|---|---|
| `1_veg_lct_prep.R` | mean over the 200 posterior draws; ET/ST/OL per cell and slice; elevation from AWS terrain tiles (`elevatr`, network); modern (age 50) vs paleo split |
| `2_calibration_lct_bluesky.R` | monthly blue-sky albedo at the modern cells, native pixel and 1-degree mean |
| `3_plot_cal_lct_albedo.R` | diagnostic plots of the calibration data (optional) |
| `4_calibration_model.R` | model ladder mod1-mod8 for every month; AIC table; spatial-effects experiment |
| `5_calibration_eval.R` | fit diagnostics; saves model 8 as the selected model per month |
| `6_prediction_model.R` | hindcast albedo per slice and month with 100 draws |
| `6_prediction_model_spatial_eval.R` | sensitivity of hindcasts to model structure (optional) |
| `7_plot_preds.R` | albedo, uncertainty and difference maps with ice overlays; coarse (7-period) albedo differences |
| `7a_alb_diff_full.R` | consecutive-slice albedo differences split into vegetation and ice parts |
| `8_radiative.R` | forcing = albedo change x kernel, three kernels, ten variants |
| `9_forcing_barplot.R` | continental forcing by period beside the IPCC AR6 agents, plus kernel-spread and variant-sensitivity figures; every aggregation choice is an explicit assumption in its header |

Not part of the pipeline: `GCM_snow_prob.R`, `thornthwaite.R`,
`beta_veg_lct_modern.R` and `scripts/archive/` (abandoned climate/snow
branch and earlier versions).

Run order is 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 7a -> 8 -> 9; 3 and
6-spatial-eval are optional, and 7 and 7a are independent of each other.
Scripts 7, 7a, 8 and 9 log a provenance manifest (see below); the others
will as they are next touched.

Measured runtimes on this machine (48 cores, capped as noted, one R thread
in the loops): script 1 ~4 min (mostly the elevation lookup); 2 ~20 min;
4 ~27 h on 8 cores, four fifths of it model 7 (the Gaussian-process cover
smooth) at ~2 h per month, every other model 1 to 5 min; 5 ~4 min; 6
~15 min; 7 62 min; 7a 52 min; 8 20 s; 9 seconds. Scripts 7 and 7a are
dominated by a per-cell `rbind` loop that is quadratic in output rows,
which is the Stage 4 consolidation in the staged plan.

Known stop: script 5 reads the spatial-experiment models from
`output/calibration/spatial_experiment/` but script 4 writes them to
`output/calibration/` (known issue 13). Its essential outputs are written
before that point, so the pipeline continues.

What each input is and where it came from:

### A note on ice

The pipeline needs to know where the ice was at each time slice, and it
answers that question from two files rather than one.

`glacier_shapefiles_21-1k.RDS` is the chronology. It supplies the mask
that stopped the vegetation interpolation inventing plants under ice
(the `ice` flag inside `veg_posts_interp_ice.RDS`, verified identical to
a point-in-polygon test of the polygons), and it supplies the ice
outlines that `7_plot_preds.R` draws on the maps. That part is
self-consistent.

The Dalton raster is used by `7a_alb_diff_full.R` for one narrow reason:
to split a cell's albedo change into a vegetation part and an ice part,
that script needs a *fraction* of the cell covered by ice, and the
polygons give only yes or no. Dalton supplies a fraction.

Rasterising the polygons already in the repository onto the 1-degree
grid with fractional coverage would produce the same quantity and leave
the pipeline with a single source of truth for ice. The trade-off is
chronology rather than method: Dalton et al. 2020 updates the older
reconstruction the polygons appear to come from, so deriving the
fraction ourselves means using the older margins consistently instead of
newer margins for the fraction and older ones for everything else. That
choice is with Andria, as question C0 in
`docs/cc/questions_for_andria_scientific.md`.

A second, separate point: `1_veg_lct_prep.R` discards the `ice` and
`cell_area` columns when it averages the posterior draws, which is why
the later scripts have to go looking for ice again at all.

### Derived files and results

All produced on this machine between 2026-09-19 and 2026-09-21 and frozen
in `tests/anchors/`; the copies in `data/` and `output/` are regenerable
and git-ignored.

### Other files in `data/`

Everything else in `data/` belongs to the point flavour (see
`docs/cc/README_nointerp.md`) or to abandoned branches: the `_albclim`,
`calibration_model*`, `cal_data`, `calibration-albedo-climate*`,
`lct_albedo_snow_modern_*`, `lct_paleo.RDS`, `pollen-modern-slice`,
`*_CRU.csv`, `*_GCM.csv` and `climate_CRU.csv` files are read by no
current script and are candidates for removal once confirmed.

Large files: anything over 50 MB is tracked with Git LFS; install
`git-lfs` before cloning or you will get pointer files. The two
downloadable kernels can also be re-fetched with
`bash tools/download_kernels.sh`; CACK must be downloaded by hand from
the EDI portal (link in the table above) and unzipped into
`data/radiative-kernels/CACKv1.0/`.

## Environment

R 4.5 with `mgcv`, `terra`, `raster`, `sp`, `sf`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`,
`reshape2`, `ggplot2`, `patchwork`, `gratia`, `tidyterra`, `scico`,
`ggtern`, `tricolore`, `scatterpie`, `fields`, `brms`, `elevatr` (needs
network). On the development machine there is no system R; a user-space
environment is used:

```
micromamba create -n paleo-rf -c conda-forge r-base r-terra r-raster r-sp r-sf \
  r-dplyr r-tidyr r-ggplot2 r-reshape2 r-mgcv r-gam r-scales r-ggally r-rastervis \
  r-scico r-scatterpie r-ggtern r-brms r-fields r-units r-ggbreak r-ncdf4 r-maps \
  r-geosphere r-patchwork
micromamba run -n paleo-rf Rscript -e 'install.packages(c("gratia","tidyterra","elevatr","tricolore"))'
```

Run scripts from the repository root. **Cap the BLAS threads to the cores
you give the job** or the fits oversubscribe the machine: an uncapped run
on 2026-09-17 sat for 2.5 hours producing nothing. A typical launch:

```
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=8 OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 MKL_NUM_THREADS=8 RUN_CORES=0-7 \
  RUN_NOTE="what this run is for" \
  nice taskset -c 0-7 micromamba run -n paleo-rf Rscript scripts/7_plot_preds.R
```

`RUN_CORES` and `RUN_NOTE` are picked up by the provenance manifest. A
package lockfile (`renv`) is planned.

## Run provenance (`runs/`)

Scripts that source `R/run_manifest.R` write one markdown file per run to
`runs/`, named by start time and script. It records the human note, the
commit that was checked out when the run **started** (and whether HEAD
moved during the run), whether `scripts/` or `R/` had uncommitted
changes, the host, cores and thread caps, R and package versions, the
script's configuration, every declared input with its md5, and every
output with its size. Three older manifests were written by hand after
the fact and are marked `RECONSTRUCTED`. Wiring the helper into a script
is two calls, `run_start()` after its configuration and `run_end()` at
the end; scripts 7, 7a, 8 and 9 have it.

## Regression anchors (`tests/anchors/`)

Frozen outputs that a refactor must still reproduce, each set with its
md5s and a README entry saying how it was made and what it does not
cover. Four sets: `nointerp-mar-2026-09-16` and `nointerp-may-2026-09-17`
(the point flavour), `interp-allmonths-2026-09-20` (scripts 1 to 6) and
`interp-tail-2026-09-21` (scripts 7, 7a, 8; 187 MB, determinism
demonstrated by a byte-identical re-run of 7a). Andria's own outputs are
preserved at the `v0-legacy` tag rather than copied;
`bash tools/restore_original_outputs.sh` brings them back.

## Working practices

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` (branches, commits, merges, where generated
material lives) and `AGENTS.md` (notes for AI-assisted sessions).
Branches: `main` (upstream, merged only by pull request), `legacy`
(frozen copy of the code as received, also tagged `v0-legacy`),
`chris-dev` (working trunk), topic branches off it that are deleted when
merged.
