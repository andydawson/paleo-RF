# prepare_bluesky_albedo.R: monthly blue-sky albedo, 2000-2009, over the land part of each
# 1-degree cell, built from the MODIS daily albedo as delivered by NASA's AppEEARS service.
# Run once, from the repository root, after tools/download_era5_radiation.R, in steps that
# are repeated month by month (see "How the build runs" below):
#
#   Rscript tools/prepare_bluesky_albedo.R requests 2005-08 2005-09   # request files for those months
#   Rscript tools/prepare_bluesky_albedo.R collect                    # check and file the downloads
#   Rscript tools/prepare_bluesky_albedo.R build                      # reduce them to monthly files
#   Rscript tools/prepare_bluesky_albedo.R build 2005-03 keep         # one month, keeping its day files
#   Rscript tools/prepare_bluesky_albedo.R cells                      # the cell table, at the end
#   Rscript tools/prepare_bluesky_albedo.R test all                   # July 2005 check (see below)
#
# It writes data/albedo_modis_cells.csv (committed), for script 2 to read when config.R chooses
# the rebuilt albedo (not wired into script 2 yet); Andria's raster
# data/blue_sky_monthly_2000-2009.tif stays the legacy setting. Settings decided by Chris on
# 2026-10-15 (questions B2c, B5) and revised on 2026-10-20 after two independent reviews of the
# build. Where a setting is our own judgement rather than published practice, it says so:
#
#   Product      MCD43A3 and MCD43A2 collection 6.1, daily, 500 m, shortwave broadband (0.3-5 um),
#                from 5 March 2000, the start of the validated record (MCD43 user guide; algorithm:
#                Schaaf et al. 2002, doi:10.1016/S0034-4257(02)00091-3; daily collection 6: Wang
#                et al. 2018, doi:10.1016/j.rse.2018.02.001). Each daily value comes from the
#                observations of a 16-day window in which that day is the ninth (days 1-16 for
#                day 9; Wang et al. 2018), not one centred on it.
#   Blue sky     (1 - f) x black-sky + f x white-sky, the isotropic approximation of the MCD43A3
#                user guide (Lucht et al. 2000, doi:10.1109/36.841980), which the guide says is
#                weakest at large solar angles over bright surfaces such as snow; Roman et al. 2010
#                (doi:10.1016/j.rse.2009.11.014) found the full anisotropic form improves the
#                biases only slightly. f is the all-sky diffuse fraction from ERA5,
#                (ssrd - fdir) / ssrd (fdir is through a horizontal plane), in the hour containing
#                local solar noon. The black-sky albedo is for local solar noon, so the result is
#                the noon blue-sky albedo, not an albedo weighted by the day's sunlight.
#   Quality      full BRDF inversions only (mandatory quality 0, 2, 4, 6), as the product team
#                recommends (MCD43A3 user guide); any processed retrieval (0-7) is kept for
#                comparison (Wang et al. 2018 validate all qualities).
#   Low sun      noon solar zenith at most 75 degrees, as in the published climatology of Jia et
#                al. 2022 (doi:10.1029/2021JD035987). Kept for comparison: 70 degrees (NASA's MODIS
#                land validation page calls values beyond 70 degrees suspect) and no rule. The
#                product stores the zenith in whole degrees, so a stored 75 passes. The rule
#                removes the north in winter: at 75 degrees, December keeps only cells south of
#                about 53 N. A day whose zenith file is missing counts only for the no-rule version.
#   Land         pixels whose land/water class (MCD43A2 BRDF_Albedo_LandWaterType) is land (1) on
#                more than half of the days it has a class, over the whole record (Chris,
#                2026-10-20). Our choice: the product is also made for coastal and shallow-water
#                areas (MCD43 user guide). A blank class means no retrieval that day and is ignored.
#                Shoreline days (class 2, "ocean coastlines and lake shorelines") are kept per pixel,
#                so LAND_RULE = 'land_or_shore' can count them with land; whether to is still open.
#   Snow         the MCD43A2 snow flag of each day (Wang et al. 2018): every version keeps all,
#                snowy and snow-free days; days with no snow flag count only in all. Each cell has
#                snowy, snow-free and unknown-snow albedos and shares that mix back exactly to the
#                all-days value (snowy and snow-free alone do so only where no day lacks a flag).
#   Averaging    our judgement: within each year, every qualifying land pixel-day of a cell counts
#                once; the years with data then weigh the same; no gap filling and no minimum
#                number of days, the counts kept beside every value. Jia et al. 2022 likewise
#                average each date over the years, but also drop the largest and smallest values;
#                Duveiller et al. 2018 (doi:10.1038/s41467-017-02810-8) take the median of
#                mid-month composites. We take the mean because forcing is linear in albedo.
#   Cells        the mean over the qualifying land pixel-days of each 1-degree cell within each
#                year, then the years weighted equally (see Averaging). The 500 m sinusoidal pixels
#                have equal area (MODIS grid), so every pixel-day stands for the same area, but
#                pixels with more qualifying days weigh more: this is not the plain area mean of
#                the pixels' own means. Oleson et al. 2003 (doi:10.1029/2002GL016749) aggregated
#                MODIS albedo to a model grid "using area weighting".
#
# How the build runs. AppEEARS cuts the six layers the build uses out of NASA's MODIS files
# for the study area and returns one GeoTIFF per layer and day on the MODIS sinusoidal grid,
# about 11 GB a month. Its scripted access has refused Chris's login since 2026-10-16, so
# requests and downloads go through the AppEEARS website, driven with Claude in Chrome (Chris,
# 2026-10-20); Chris stays signed in, and approves each batch of submissions and downloads:
#   1. "requests" writes one request file per month to data/modis_albedo/requests/.
#   2. On https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov: Extract -> Area Sample -> "Upload a request
#      file" (on the options page, before the form), then submit.
#   3. When it has finished: Explore -> the request's download page -> every file, into
#      ~/Downloads.
#   4. "collect" checks every downloaded GeoTIFF against the request's SHA-256 list, moves the
#      month into data/modis_albedo/appeears/<year-month>/ (through "<year-month>.partial", so an
#      interrupted move is finished by running collect again, at whatever point it stopped), and
#      keeps the checksum list and AppEEARS's other files (its copy of the request, the granule
#      list, metadata; named with hyphens) in data/modis_albedo/records/<year-month>/.
#   5. "build" checks the month's files against the checksum list again, checks that every layer
#      was delivered, that at least one day has every albedo, quality, snow and land layer and that
#      at least one such day also has the noon solar zenith, and that the request asked for the right
#      days and layers. AppEEARS's copy of the request must be in the records and ask for the same
#      dates, layers and area as our request file; with "keep" a missing or different copy only
#      gives a warning. Any of these failing stops the build before anything is built or deleted.
#      It then reduces the month tile by tile to data/modis_albedo/monthly/<tile>_<year>_<month>.tif
#      (per-pixel sums and counts, tagged with the settings and this script's SHA-256), checks every
#      layer of each new file under a temporary name before naming it, adds a section to
#      records/<year-month>/build.txt (code, settings, inputs, days used and skipped, each tile's
#      origin, retrievals lost), and only then deletes the month's day files. "keep" keeps them for
#      good (a KEEP file in the day folder, written before the month is built so that a failed
#      build leaves it too; later builds without month names skip that month).
#   6. Once every month is built, "cells" decides the land pixels and writes the cell table, with
#      a note beside it of the land rule and the script versions that made the monthly files. It
#      stops if any monthly file was made with other settings, or by a version of this script that
#      is neither this one nor one on the short list ACCEPTED_OLDER_SHAS, or does not record which
#      version made it (Chris, 2026-10-21). After an edit to this script, either every month is rebuilt, from day files
#      downloaded again where they were deleted, or the old version's SHA-256 is added to that list,
#      once it has been checked to compute the same numbers (e.g. a change to comments only, seen
#      in the diff); its entry says what changed and how that was checked. Reuse at build time
#      stays strict: a tile file is reused only if this version made it.
# Every step can be rerun: requests are not written for months already collected or built, a
# month already collected is not collected again, and a tile-month whose file exists is reused,
# unless it was made with other settings or by another version of this script, which stops the
# build. Without this script's own SHA-256, "build" and "test" stop before anything else they do,
# and "cells" before it reads any monthly file.
#
# "test" builds July 2005 from data/modis_albedo/appeears_full_2005-07/ (downloaded 2026-10-19,
# before the noon solar zenith layer was added to the requests, so the zenith is taken as 0:
# valid only for July, when the noon sun is everywhere within 61 degrees of the zenith) into
# data/modis_albedo/test_appeears_v4/, and with "test all" also that month's cell table, to
# compare with Andria's raster. Nothing under data/modis_albedo/ or data/era5/ is committed.
