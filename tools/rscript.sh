# Run an R script with the project environment set up the way every anchored run was.
#
# Why: calling the env's Rscript binary directly leaves PROJ_DATA/GDAL_DATA unset (they are
# only set by `micromamba activate`), which breaks script 1's elevation lookup and the sf
# map helpers; and predict.gam reproduces byte for byte only at the BLAS thread count of
# the anchored runs (8). This wrapper fixes both, so comparison runs are like for like.
#
# Usage: tools/rscript.sh <script.R> [args...]
#   THREADS=8 by default; CORES (a taskset list, e.g. 0-7) optional.
